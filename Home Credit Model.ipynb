And, unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders.\n","\n","Home Credit strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. In order to make sure this underserved population has a positive loan experience, Home Credit makes use of a variety of alternative data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities.\n","\n","While Home Credit is currently using various statistical and machine learning methods to make these predictions, they're challenging Kagglers to help them unlock the full potential of their data. Doing so will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successful.\n","\n","https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk\n","\n","The objective of this competition is to use historical loan application data to predict whether or not an applicant will be able to repay a loan. This is a standard supervised classification task:\n","\n","Supervised: The labels are included in the training data and the goal is to train a model to learn to predict the labels from the features.\n","\n","Classification: The label is a binary variable, 0 (will repay loan on time), 1 (will have difficulty repaying

Your credit report is primarily a detailed list of your credit history, consisting of information provided by lenders that have extended credit to you. While information may vary from one credit reporting agency to another, the credit reports include the same types of information, such as the names of lenders that have extended credit to you, types of credit you have, your payment history, and more. \n","\n","In addition to the credit report, lenders may also use a credit score that is a numeric value – usually between 300 and 850 – based on the information contained in your credit report. The credit score serves as a risk indicator for the lender based on your credit history. Generally, the higher the score, the lower the risk. Credit bureau scores are often called \"FICO® scores\" because many credit bureau scores used in the U.S. are produced from software developed by Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO). While many lenders use credit scores to help them make their lending decisions, each lender has its own criteria, depending on the level of risk it finds acceptable for a given credit product.\n","\n","<b>Capacity:</b> Lenders need to determine whether you can comfortably afford your payments. Your income and employment history are good indicators of your ability to repay outstanding debt. Income amount, stability, and type of income may all be considered. The ratio of your current and any new debt as compared to your before-tax income, known as debt-to-income ratio (DTI), may be evaluated.\n","\n","<b>Collateral (when applying for secured loans):</b> Loans, lines of credit, or credit cards you apply for may be secured or unsecured. With a secured product, such as an auto or home equity loan, you pledge something you own as collateral. The value of your collateral will be evaluated, and any existing debt secured by that collateral will be subtracted from the value. The remaining equity will play a factor in the lending decision.\n","\n","<b>Capital:</b> While your household income is expected to be the primary source of repayment, capital represents the savings, investments, and other assets that can help repay the loan. This can be helpful if you lose your job or experience other setbacks.\n","\n","<b>Conditions:</b> Lenders may want to know how you plan to use the money and will consider the loan’s purpose, such as whether the loan will be used to purchase a vehicle or other property.

Random Forest - Bagging ensemble of Decision trees"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"hTvfpJvKl8eq"},"source":["A decision tree is a Machine Learning algorithm capable of fitting complex datasets and performing both classification and regression tasks. The idea behind a tree is to search for a pair of variable-value within the training set and split it in such a way that will generate the \"best\" two child subsets. The goal is to create branches and leafs based on an optimal splitting criteria, a process called tree growing. Specifically, at every branch or node, a conditional statement classifies the data point based on a fixed threshold in a specific variable, therefore splitting the data. To make predictions, every new instance starts in the root node (top of the tree) and moves along the branches until it reaches a leaf node where no further branching is possible.\n","\n","![random%20forest.png](attachment:random%20forest.png)\n","image source: https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/10/random-forests-explained.html\n","\n","Random Forests are trained via the bagging method. Bagging or Bootstrap Aggregating, consists of randomly sampling subsets of the training data, fitting a model to these smaller data sets, and aggregating the predictions. This method allows several instances to be used repeatedly for the training stage given that we are sampling with replacement. Tree bagging consists of sampling subsets of the training set, fitting a Decision Tree to each, and aggregating their result.\n","\n","In relation to sklearn: \n","\n","\n","A random forest is a collection of random decision trees (of number n_estimators in sklearn). What you need to understand is how to build one random decision tree.\n","\n","Roughly speaking, to build a random decision tree you start from a subset of your training samples. At each node you will draw randomly a subset of features (number determined by max_features in sklearn). For each of these features you will test different thresholds and see how they split your samples according to a given criterion (generally entropy or gini, criterion parameter in sklearn). Then you will keep the feature and its threshold that best split your data and record it in the node. When the construction of the tree ends (it can be for different reasons: maximum depth is reached (max_depth in sklearn), minimum sample number is reached (min_samples_leaf in sklearn) etc.) you look at the samples in each leaf and keep the frequency of the labels. As a result, it is like the tree gives you a partition of your training samples according to meaningful features.\n","\n","As each node is built from features taken randomly, you understand that each tree built in this way will be different. This contributes to the good compromise between bias and variance.\n","\n","Then in testing mode, a test sample will go through each tree, giving you label frequencies for each tree. The most represented label is generally the final classification result.\n","\n","https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31344732/a-simple-explanation-of-random-forest<br>\n","Original paper:

So when growing on the same leaf in Light GBM, the leaf-wise algorithm can reduce more loss than the level-wise algorithm and hence results in much better accuracy which can rarely be achieved by any of the existing boosting algorithms.

In simple terms, a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature. For example, a fruit may be considered to be an apple if it is red, round, and about 3 inches in diameter. Even if these features depend on each other or upon the existence of the other features, all of these properties independently contribute to the probability that this fruit is an apple and that is why
